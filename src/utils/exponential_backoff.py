    Executes a function with exponential backoff retry logic.

    Args:
        func (Callable): The function to execute.
        retries (int): Maximum number of retries. Default is 3.
        initial_delay (float): Initial delay in seconds. Default is 2.
        backoff_factor (float): Factor by which delay increases. Default is 2.
        max_delay (float): Maximum delay in seconds. Default is 32.
        jitter_factor (float): Jitter range (0.3 = Â±30%). Default is 0.3.
        **kwargs: Arguments to pass to the function.

    Returns:
        Any: The result of the function if successful.

    Raises:
        Exception: If all retries fail, the last exception is raised.
